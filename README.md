The [DosTres Automation Controller](http://kippkitts.com/collections/frontpage/products/dostres-automation-controller-kk-m-23) is a shield for the Arduino Uno that allows you to control a number of high power devices.  It carries motor drivers to power 2 brush DC motors at 40v/5A as well as 3 MOSFET load switches to control high load devices (solenoids, lights, pumps, etc.).  The DosTres also allows you to drive a stepper motor in place of the DC motors.  The Eagle files for this board can be found here.
